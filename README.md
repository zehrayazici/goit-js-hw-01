# goit-js-hw-01

This project was developed to practice core JavaScript fundamentals and to gain hands‑on experience implementing script behavior within a static web page context, in accordance with the GoIT curriculum.

In alignment with modern web development basics:

- JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM and handle basic interactive logic associated with the HTML structure.
- Functional decomposition is emphasized through separate script files organized under a dedicated directory (`js/`).
- Standard coding conventions are applied to improve readability, including descriptive variable and function names.
- The repository demonstrates careful handling of user input and dynamic behaviors without relying on external libraries.
- All related HTML and script resources are organized clearly to maintain project structure and facilitate further enhancement.

This repository represents the first assignment in the GoIT JavaScript module and reflects an introductory application of JavaScript principles within a client‑side environment.
